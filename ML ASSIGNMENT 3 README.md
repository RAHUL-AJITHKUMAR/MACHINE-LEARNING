Preprocessing Explanation:

1. Loading Data: The dataset is loaded directly from sklearn which ensures data quality and consistency.

2. Missing Values: The California Housing dataset from sklearn is clean with no missing values, so no imputation was needed.

3. Feature Scaling: Standardization (subtracting mean and dividing by standard deviation) was performed because:

* The features have different scales (e.g., MedInc ranges ~0-15 while AveBedrms ~0-2)

* Many algorithms (especially SVR and gradient-based methods) perform better with standardized features

* It helps prevent features with larger scales from dominating the model


1. Linear Regression

Explanation: Linear Regression models the relationship between features and target as a linear equation. It's suitable here because:

* The relationship between housing features and price may be approximately linear

* It provides interpretable coefficients showing how each feature affects price

* It's computationally efficient and serves as a good baseline

2. Decision Tree Regressor

Explanation: Decision Trees split the data recursively based on feature values. Suitable because:

* Can capture non-linear relationships in the data

* Handles mixed feature types well (though all ours are numeric)

* Doesn't require extensive preprocessing (though we standardized anyway)

3. Random Forest Regressor

Explanation: Random Forest builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions. Suitable because:

* Reduces overfitting compared to single decision trees

* Handles non-linear relationships well

* Provides feature importance scores

* Generally performs well on tabular data like this

4. Gradient Boosting Regressor

Explanation: Gradient Boosting builds trees sequentially, each correcting the previous one's errors. Suitable because:

* Often achieves state-of-the-art performance on regression problems

* Can model complex relationships in the data

* Handles heterogeneous features well

* Less prone to overfitting than single trees

5. Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Explanation: SVR finds a hyperplane that best fits the data while allowing some error. Suitable because:

* Effective in high-dimensional spaces (though ours is only 8 features)

* Can model non-linear relationships using kernel trick

* Robust to outliers to some degree

Results Analysis:

1. Best-performing algorithm:

* Gradient Boosting Regressor typically performs best with the highest RÂ² and lowest MSE/MAE

* Justification: Its sequential error-correction approach effectively models the complex relationships in housing data while being robust to overfitting

2. Worst-performing algorithm:

* SVR generally performs worst among these options

* Reasoning: Without extensive hyperparameter tuning and with the default kernel, SVR struggles to match the performance of ensemble methods on this dataset. It's also more computationally expensive without providing better results in this case.

3. Observations:

* Ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) outperform simpler models

* Linear Regression provides decent baseline performance but is limited by its linearity assumption

* Decision Tree tends to overfit without proper tuning, performing worse than the ensemble variants
