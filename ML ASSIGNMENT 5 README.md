# 1. Loading and Preprocessing
First, let's load the Iris dataset from sklearn and preprocess it by dropping the species labels since this is an unsupervised learning problem.

# 2. Clustering Algorithm Implementation
# A) KMeans Clustering
# How KMeans works:
KMeans is a centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions data into k clusters. It works by:

* Randomly initializing k centroids

* Assigning each data point to the nearest centroid

* Recalculating centroids as the mean of all points in the cluster

* Repeating steps 2-3 until centroids stabilize or max iterations reached

# Suitability for Iris dataset:
KMeans is suitable for the Iris dataset because:

The data is numerical with clear separation between some species

The clusters are roughly spherical and similarly sized

We know there are 3 species (so k=3 makes biological sense)

# B) Hierarchical Clustering
# How Hierarchical clustering works:
* Hierarchical clustering creates a tree of clusters (dendrogram) by either:

* Agglomerative (bottom-up): Start with each point as its own cluster and merge closest pairs

* Divisive (top-down): Start with all points in one cluster and recursively split

# Suitability for Iris dataset:
Hierarchical clustering is suitable because:

It doesn't require specifying number of clusters upfront

The dendrogram can help identify natural cluster count

Works well with small datasets like Iris (150 samples)


# Comparison and Interpretation
Both methods should reveal 3 main clusters that roughly correspond to the original Iris species, though with some possible misclassification especially between versicolor and virginica which have more overlap in feature space.

The dendrogram from hierarchical clustering provides additional insight into how the clusters merge at different distances, which can help determine if 3 is indeed the optimal number of clusters.
